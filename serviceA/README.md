# Getting Started

This is a sample spring microservice which shows:

- Expose a restful layer  (HATEAOS , HAL style) on top of a repo
- READ environment variables ( which is populated by Kubernetes)
    - variables are coming from configmap and secrets 
    
# Install

- First ensure you have MiniKube and kubectl running
- In your terminal

    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ make k8s-all-create    
    ```
    - refere to makefile for more details

- Running inside a local docker
     ```console
     foo@bar:~$ make run-local 
     foo@bar:~$ curl localhost:8080/env 
      ```
- Retrieve service endpoint (Kubernetes cluster)
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ make k8s-service-url   
    ``` 
- Navigate data api  (HATEAOS)
     ```console
     foo@bar:~$ curl <ENDPOINT HERE>/api 
     ```
- Show loaded variables from k8s (will show null if running locally) 
     ```console
     foo@bar:~$ curl <ENDPOINT HERE>/env 
     ```
